## Description
Module 18 Challenge was to create a social network API using NoSQL and MongoDB which can be used to handle a vast amount of unstructured data, Mongoose ODM, and moment package for time stamls, as well as Express for routing.

## Installation
MongoDB must be installed.

Use the following:
```npm init -y```

```npm i express mongoose moment```

Start the server using:
```npm start```

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Testing
Use insomnia to test all API routes.
```api/users```

1. ```GET``` all users
2. ```POST``` Create user

```/api/users/:userid```

1. ```GET``` a single user by its ```_id```
2.```PUT``` to update a user by its ```_id```
3. ```DELETE``` to remove user by its ```_id```

```/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId```

1. ```POST``` to add a new friend to a user's friend list
2. ```DELETE``` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

```/api/thoughts```

1. ```GET``` to get all thoughts
2. ```POST``` to create a new thought

```/api/thoughts/:thoughtId```

1. ```GET``` to get a single thought by its _id
2. ```PUT``` to update a thought by its _id
3. ```DELETE``` to remove a thought by its _id
```/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions```

1. ```POST``` to create a reaction

```/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId```

1. ```DELETE``` remove a reaction by the reactionId
